<p style = "color : red">Hey Matt, this is my first project for the class. I already did a Hello World as a test run! </p>
<p style = "color : orange"><span title="It worked like a charm! :)">Hover your mouse over this sentence to see how it went.</span> </p>

<p style = "color:yellow"> Something I didn't really think too hard about when I answered your survey during our first class was that I took HTML in highschool. <p> 
<p style = "color : green">I'm by no means an expert, and I had to Google how to even format all this stuff, but it's coming back to me slowly. It's all I know for now.<p> 
<p style = "color : blue">I think HTML is a pretty cool language, but I'd be more excited to learn Python.</p> 
<p style = "color : powderblue"><span title="I was going to put Indigo as this font color, but it looked horrible. Powder Blue looks much better.">My second project will probably be in Python once I figure out how to get it to work with Visual Studio Code.</span></p> 
<p style = "color : violet">A couple of my friends are engineers and when I told them about an app idea I had, they said that was probably the best language for it.</p> 



<p style = "color:white">Thanks for reading!</p>
